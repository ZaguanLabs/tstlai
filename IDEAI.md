# IDEAI Context File

## Project Overview

This directory contains a project named "tstlai" which appears to be a TypeScript-based AI assistant or language interface project. Based on the limited files present, this is a nascent project that is in early stages of development.

### Key Information

- **Project Name**: tstlai
- **Primary Language**: TypeScript (inferred from project name and context)
- **Purpose**: Appears to be an AI assistant/language interface, possibly for testing or demonstration purposes
- **License**: MIT License

### Project Structure

Currently, the project has a minimal structure:
```
/home/stig/dev/ai/zaguan/labs/tstlai/
├── LICENSE (MIT License)
├── README.md (Basic project information)
├── .git/ (Version control)
└── docs/
    └── initial-thoughts.md (Conceptual documentation)
```

## Documentation

### README.md
Contains basic project identification:
- Project name: tstlai
- Brief description mentioning TypeScript and AI
- Simple setup and usage instructions placeholder

### docs/initial-thoughts.md
Contains conceptual thinking about the project:
- Ideas about creating a TypeScript-based AI assistant
- Discussion of potential architecture approaches
- Notes about leveraging existing AI models and SDKs
- Thoughts on implementation strategies

## Development Status

This project is in very early development stages with:
- Basic project structure established
- Conceptual documentation in place
- Version control initialized
- MIT license applied

## Building and Running

As this is an early-stage project, specific build and run commands are not yet established. Based on the TypeScript indication, the project would likely use:

```bash
# Install dependencies (once package.json is created)
npm install

# Build the project (once build scripts are defined)
npm run build

# Run the project (once entry points are defined)
npm start

# Development mode (once configured)
npm run dev
```

## Development Conventions

Since this is a new project, formal conventions have not yet been established. However, based on the context:

1. **Language**: TypeScript is the intended primary language
2. **Documentation**: Initial thoughts are captured in markdown files in the docs directory
3. **Version Control**: Git is being used for version control
4. **Licensing**: MIT License has been applied

## Next Steps

To develop this project further, the following would typically be needed:
1. Package configuration (package.json)
2. Source code directory structure (src/)
3. Implementation of the concepts outlined in initial-thoughts.md
4. Testing framework setup
5. Build and deployment configurations

## Project Context

This project appears to be part of a larger AI initiative under the "zaguan" organization, specifically in a "labs" directory suggesting experimental or research-oriented work.
